ings of a similar nature, or it may even have been
invitatione or requests, backed by the offer or the gift
of lands for sites, and the like, which are less well
known, and as mentioned at all, mentioned so as to
show manifestly they were misunderstood. Such was
the gift of land by Olaf, King of Man, and of other land
by Walter de Gant, at Stainton‚ and in either instance
with the distinct statement that the donation was made
“ ad abbatiam constituendam '³ or “ construendam.''

As to the first-named of these two cases, in the
Oronicon Manniae‚ under the date MOXXXIV„ there is the
entry, “ Olavus Rex dedit Yvoni, Abbati de Fumea,
partem terrae suae in Mannia ad abbatiam constituen-
dam in loco qui vocatur Russin.'' There is, besideS,
among the Duchy Charters at the Public Record Office,
one numbered 256 in the Public Records Report of
1875, which is thus described by the editor :—“ Letter
from King Olaf of Man, wherein he directs that the
Bishops of Man and the Isles shall be chosen in the
Ohurch of St. Mary of Furness‚ and he confirms his gift
of a piece of land to construet an abbey.'' The date of
this document ie, by the compiler of the Report, made
to lie between 1134 and 1139. But, as I have remarked
in the Introductory Chapter to the Furness Concher
Book (Ohetham Society, p. xxx), “ there is another
matter, in the same connection, remaining to be noticed‚
and that is the previous grant by Olaf to Rievaulx of
the aforesaid land in or near to Russyn. The state·

confirmavit? From a confirmator-y Ang. vol. i. p. 866), it appears that
charter of King Hem-y 11. to the the Abbey, which was founded in
monks of Sibton in Norfolk (Mon. 1150, was a daughter of Wardon.”
