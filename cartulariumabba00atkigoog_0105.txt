bishop Romanus (Reg. fo, xxxb). This date must of necessity
be Feb. 2d in 1287; for the Archbishop was consecrated at
Rome on the loth of February in 1286, and thus he could
scarcely have been at wilton on the 2d‚ and at Rome on the
loth, allowing for all the difficulties of so long a Journey. But
there is no doubt that Thomas had become Abbot in, or
probably before, 12863 for, among the “ Pedes finium. Ebor„
13-26 Edw. 1.” is one dated “in crastino Ascensionis Domini
14 Edw. 1.,'’ between Abbot Thomas of Rievaulx and William
de Ia Hay, acting on behalf of his wife, in re certain lands in
Little Busby, etc.; and, inasmuch as this Fine has been acci-
dentally omitted in the Appendix, I subjoin the following very
brief abstract :—“ Haec est finalis etc. coram Thoma de Wey-
laund, J oh. de Luvetot‚ Will. de Brunton, Rog. de Leycestre,
et Elia de Belingham, J usticiariiS, etc„ Inter Fratrem Thomam,
Abbatem Rimllis, per Ric. de Perk, etc„ et will. de la Hay et
Elenam uxorem ejuS, etc„ de uno mesuagiO, etc., in Parva
Buskeby,’' and other tenements in Staynburghe, Pyllaye, and
Cuthworthe. In No. cnxxvm. (printed in the Appendix) his
name is found mentioned as Abbot in September 1291.

17. HENRY 11.—This Abbot’s name does not appear in
Burton's list, or in any other with which Ι am acquainted.
Still, there seems to be sufficient reason for inserting it in
the present list. The authority depended on is an extract
from the Clairvaux Chartulary given by Longstaffe in the
Appendix to his “Darlington,” pp. lxi, lxii, which runs as
follows :—“ 6 Kal. Apr. 1301. Henry, Abbot,and the Convent
of Ryevall, in public Chapter, . . . established three monks of
their House to celebrate three messes for ever for the health and
prosperity of life of their beloved in Christ, Master Simon de
Clervaux, Rector of Lith, from that date, at three altars in their
church, viz„ at the altar of S. Matthew, where a mass of the
Blessed Virgin is celebrated3 at the altar of S. Martin the
Bishop, where one for all the faithful departed is celebrated
daily3 and at the altar of the Blessed Thomas the Martyr, a
mass3 so that the three monks at the three altarS, while
Master Simon lived, should say a collect for his special health‚
viz„ Deus, qui caritatis dona, etc., in a convenient place 3 and
at a mass at S. Martin's altar aforesaid, to be daily celebrated
for the soul of Sir Thomas de Clervaux, his brother, a special
collect in like manner daily should be said, viz„ DeuS, cui
proprium est, etc„ in the same place, or other convenient
place: but when Master Simon, whose prosperous life might
the Highest prolong, should die, at the three masses celebrated
