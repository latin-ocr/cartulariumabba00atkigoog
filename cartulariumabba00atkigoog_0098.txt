date assigned for his death by the Melrose Chronicler ’' (Hex-
ham Book, i. p. 193 n.). The entry in the Chronica stands:
“ A⁰ Mclxvii., obiit piae memoriae Aldredus‚ 111. Abbas Rievallis,
cui successit Silvanus, Abbas de Dundraynan.” It is impos-
sible to overlook the distinctly precise statement that Aelred
was the third Abbot of Rievaulx, which admitted, Waltheof's
claim to be reckoned among the Abbots quite disappears. But
over and above this, there are other considerations which I do
not think ought to be ignored, as bearing upon Mr. Walbran's
notiori that Prior Waltheof of Kirkham became successively
Abbot of Rievaulx and of Melrose. Mr. Walbran, as already
noted (p. xxviii w), states that Prior Waltheof was a kinsman of
the Earl of Albemarle, and that it was through his (Waltheof’s)
influence that the latter founded the Religious House at
Thornton. Assuming that identification to be ascertained, the
Mailros Chronicler affords us abundant means of identifying
the Abbot of Melrose who was distinguished by the same
name. At p. 167 is the following entry :—“ Anno Mcxlvi„
Walthevus, frater Henrici, Comitis N orthimbrorum, et SimoniS,
Comitis Northumptonae, factus est Abbas de Mailros,” and on
the following page‘ ’ΘΑ Mclix. obiit piae memoriae WaldevuS,
Abbas secundus de Mauros, iii non. Augusti, qui fuit avun-
culus Regis M[alcolmi], et Willelmus, ejusdem ecclesias mona-
chus, ei successit.” Dugdale, it is true, does not mention
Henry, here described as “Comes Northimbrorum‚ ’² but he
names Simon, Earl of Northampton, aud Waltheof, Abbot of
Melrose, and names them as sons of Earl Simon St. Liz by
Maud, daughter of Waltheof, late Farl of Northumbria, who,
for her second husband, had King David of Scotland. H’e was
succeeded on the throne of Scotland by his grandson, Mal-
colm IV„ sou of Henry of Huntingdon, who was thus half-
brother of Abbot Waltheof. Hence the descriptive‘ ‘avunculus
M.” There can therefore be no reasonable doubt who
Abbot Waltheof of Melrose really was, and that he was an
utterly different person from Prior Waltheof of Kirkham.

4. SYLVANUS.—After Aelred in Burton’s “ catalogue of the
Abbots of Rieval,'' as fourth Abbot is named Roget, with the
date 1175 prefixed to his name; and as fifth, Bernard, with
the date 1180 affixed3 and, as authority, is quoted‘ ‘Willis’ s
Hist. of Abbies, v, 2, p. 282· Lib. Rieval. p. 83, Johnston's
uss, v. K. i. p. 83.” I have been so far unable to consult
either of the authorities cited, but there would seem to be con-
siderable difficulties ιιι the way of accepting either the Abbots
themselve8‚ or the dates alleged as the dates at which they
