and executed for complicity in the Pilgrimage of Grace is pro-
bably certain; but that it was not the Abbot regnant at the
time is more than equally certain. As to the former of these
two allegatione, Mr. Walbran (Memor-tals of Fountaim, p. 273)
writes: “ Henriquez, in his Menoloqium Cistercieme, p. 185,
says ‘ Nonis Junii, Londini in Anglia, passio beatorum Guil—
lelmi Trust ’ [for Thirsk] ‘ Abbatis Fontanensis‚ et Abbatis
Riveriensis, Ordinis Cisterc„ qui propter fidem etc! '⁹ And
in the following paragraph is added, “ Gulielmus Trust, Abbas
Monast. Fontanensis [et] Abbas Riveriensis ambo suspensi et
in quatuor divisi partes.” There seems to be no real doubt
that this is the record of an actual fact. And Ι think that the

predecessor, or (as he is described in writings of the time),
quondam Abbas. There is, Ι think, no difficulty in the way
of establishing the fact that there was such a person—that
Blyton's predecessor vacated the office of Abbot by cession,
and not by death. Mr. Walbran (hiemo-tals, p. 260) publishes
“ A letter from Thomas Legh to Cromwell, respecting the con-
duct of William Thirsk, Abbot of F ountain3‚ and the Abbot of
Rievaulx,” obtained from the Cott. MSS. Cleop. Ε. IV. I have
copy of the same from Dodsworth, xxvi. 10, headed z—-“ A
breefe from Dalton [sic] Lee to Oromwell, 1 Sept.” Mr. Wal-
bran’s note upon this letter—the bearing of which on the
question now before us will be dealt with presently—is: “ It
appears from this letter, which was probably written in the
autumn of the year 1535 ''—a date which I am inclined to
think is fully two years too late—‘⁶ when the first general
visitation of the monasteries commenced, that the visitors had
found occasion to depose the Abbot of RievauIX, and that the
king had commanded the Abbot of FountainS, who was then
the visitor-General of the Cistercian Order, to confirm or con-
summate their act. [This is misstated. The said Abbot was
really, as will be seen below, one of the commissioners origin·
ally and specially employed] His reluctance to under-take
this and contingent duties mentioned in the two succeeding
letters in the text waS, no doubt, dictated by a strong sym·
pathetic feeling with the offender, exemplified not only in the
reports of their characters generally, but by the fact that they
soon after joined the Pilgrimage of Grace, and died for that.
cause on the scaffold.’' Much of the pertinency of no incon·
siderable part of this depends upon the date, which, as noted
above, may be demurred to. For, in the first place, in 1535
Rowland Blyton was Abbot (see Conventual Leasesfflaseim), and
