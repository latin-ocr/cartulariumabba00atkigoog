⁴ No Rodulfus, Dcan of York‚ is
recorded b Le Neve3 and it has
been sl noted that but two
datos for t o two Deam named
Robert are given—the one 1148, and
tho other 1186. Further, it is
definitely stated that John became
trenam-er in 1154, and was consc-
cratod Bishop of Poictiers in 1163.
It is, therefore, safer to let Radulfus
stand than to ‘⁸ correct ’³ it by sub·
stituting Robort. The implication
may be verified some day.

namo is correctl written, imsmuch

Still, it is the namo of a hm, and
