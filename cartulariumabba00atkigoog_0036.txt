the motives which led to the formation of this plan of
surrender on the part of Kirkham, and to the arrange-
ment of the terms on which it was to be carried into
effect, have passed it by entirely without notice. All
the canons and brethren of Kirkham were to have—of

remove from Kirkham, but that they will not part with
their Prior until all the conditions stated shall have been
fully complied with and satisfied in all points: “ Non
voluimus amittere Priorem nostrum.”

There seems to mc to be but one solution to the ques-
