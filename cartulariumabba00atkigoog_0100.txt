authority cites “ Chron. de Mailros, p. 17 8,” adding that “ he
was buried at Byland.'' There are two entries relevant to him
in the authority quoted, which are as follows 2— “ Anno
Mclxxxviii: Silvanus, Abbas quartus Rievanis, villicationem
suam Deo humiliter ac simpliciter resignavit, apud Dundren-
nan.'’ Immediately in succession to this comes the entry :-—
“ Anno Mclxxxix, Ernaldus, Abbas de MeIrOS, electus est ad
curam animarum de Rievalle, vi non. Martii, feria quinta.''
And then a third entry follows, touching the death of Silvanus
-- “Anno Mclxxxi obiit piae memoriae Silvanus, quondam
Abbas Rievallis, vii idus Octobris, apud Bellelande, ibique
honorifice sepultus est.'’ And there are three points to be
noted here: first that Silvanus is specifically mentioned as the
fourth in the succession of Abbots; second, that he resigned his
overseership to God in the year preceding that of his death3
third, that on his resignation he appears to have retired to
Byland, where he died, and was honourably buried. His
enumeration as fourth Abbot formally excludes Waltheof, Roger,
and Bernard from the corrected list. of the Abbot who
succeeded Silvanus nothing seems to be known but his name,

and for that Burton quotes Willis, as before in the case of
Roget and Bernard.

5. ERNALD. -- At this point I find myself compelled to
deviate from the succession of Abbots as given in both Dugdale
and Burton, not to mention other and less authoritative com-
pilers, Thus Burton's list runs :—-1. William3 2. Maurice3
3. Aelredus; 4. Roger3 5. Bernard3 6. Sylvan; 7. Godfrey;
8. Ernaldus; 9. William Punchard. On first dealing with
this successim, I had written touching Godfrey: “ Of the
Abbot who succeeded Sylvanus nothing seems to be known but
his name3 and for that Burton quotes Willis, as before, in the
case of Roger and Bernard.’' But it becomes necessary to
modify this statement, inasmuch as at p. 181 of the Chronica
de Mailros the following precise statement is found :-—-—“ Anno
Mociv, Dominus Gaufridus administrationem Rievallis sus-
cepit? If this stood by itself its significance might not be so
great. But it does not so stand. On the contiary, on the
same authority, at p. 181, occurs the following entry :—“ Anno
Mcxcix‚ Dominus Ernaldus cessit curae pastorali, cui successit
Dominus Willelmus de Punchard,'' the next entry after which
is, “ Anno Mociii, obiit WillelmuS, Abbas Rievallis.” It is
clear, then, that Ernahl, having been elected Abbot in 1189,
and very shortly after the resignation of his predecessor,
Sylvanus, continued Abbot up to 1 199, when he resigned, and
