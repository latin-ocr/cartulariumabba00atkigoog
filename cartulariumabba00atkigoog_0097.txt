how long there is nothing to show—he continued ιο be Prior
there. But inasmuoh as Abbot William did not die until
August 1145, and Ailred or Etheldred was Abbot before De-
cember 1147, it is obvious that Waltheof's occupancy of the
abbatial chair, if he ever did occupy it, must have been of . the
briefest character. For it seems hardly possible to throw over
entirely the statement of the Melrose Chronicler given above
as to the fact that Maurice was Abbot for at least some short
time, in succession to William. And, even sn, we would have
ιο ignore the equally precise statement of the same authority
as to the immediate succession of Aelred to Maurice. But
whether we admit οι· reject the allegation that Waltheof, late
Prior of Kirkham, was for a time, however short, Abbot of
Rievaulx, it is hardly possible to be blind ιο the possible illus·
tration herein found, of that remarkable phrase in the cyro-
graph between Kirkham and Rievaulx, on which comment has
been made at a previous page (pp. xxvi, xxvii): “ Hoc quoque
sciendum est quod nec a loco nostro voluimus discedere, nec
Priorem nostrum amittere, donec ea quae inter nos constituta sunt
ad debitum finem producta fuerint,” ιο say nothing of the final
clause of the same document, which stipulates that the seced·-
ing Kirkham canons and brethren should have the same stand-
ing in the Chapter and Order of Cisteaux as any monk of the
said Order. If the approximate date assigned to this cyro-
graph be correct (see above, pp, xxiv, xxv), it was too early by
four or five years at least to think of losing their Prior in con-
sequence of his “ secession '³ to become Abbot of Rievauht.

We learn from Regin-ald that Aelred was at Kirkcudbright in
