pleasures that may thereby ensue, all affectione sette aparte,
ye doo accomplishe the said eleccion according to the tenour
and purporte of his most gracious letters directyd unto you
a‘nd to the convente of the same monastery in that behalf.”
In this letter we note the direct charge of delay in the execu-
tion οἱ the mandate addressed to the Abbots named for the
election of a successor to the Abbot spoken of in the last letter

—interest or affection—as having led to such delay, and a
peremptory order to interpose no further delay, but to
proceed at once in conj unction with the Convent to the election
of a new Abbot. The third letter it may be better to preface
by the insertion of the following letter from the Oromwell
Correspondence (Second Series), xxii. fc. 467 :——“ In my

Here then we have the practical reply to the peremptory man·
date conveyed in the last letter noticed. On St. Nicholas’ Day
(December eth) a new Abbot was installed at Rievaulx, who
had previously been the Abbot at Rufforth, and the ex-Abbot
