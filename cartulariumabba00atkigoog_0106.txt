18. ROBERT.—“ In 1301 Robert occurS,” is the Mona-sticon
notice of this Abbot, and the reference is to “ Addenda to
Tanner’s notitia, by Willis.” This doubtless depende on an'
enti-y in Archbishop Corbridge's Register, fc. xxvi.; but the
enti-y is made on a loose‚ or rather on an inserted, slip, and
it finds its place on the fo. dealing with the acts of the third
year of the Pontificate. This brings the profession of Abbot
Robert into the year 1303 instead of 1301. The profession is
made in the usual form.

19. PmssR—Prefixed to this Abbot's name in the Monastioon
is “ February 1307,” with a reference to Archbishop Grenfield’s
Ιέξξῗιθτ, p. 86. I have met with no other mention of Abbot

20. THOMAS 11.—The name of this Abbot has not been met
within any of the lists of Abbots of Rievaulx hitherto com-
piled. But there is no room for doubt as to the fact that he
was Abbot “le utisme jour Daverisse, lan du regne le Roy
Edward fiths Ie Roy Edward utisme.’' (See No, CXLVV.) This
is one of the chart-ers in Lord Bolton's most interesting collec-
tion, and, by its own date, it dates. also the next in the series
as printed, or N 0. chvW, in which the name of the same Abbot
occurs again. On March 26, 1315, the transaction referred to
iu both these deeds was ratified by the other party to it, or Sir
Henry Ie Scrope, and confirmed by the then Bishop of Durham.
Five days later the Prior and Convent of Durham add their
confirmation to the exchange specified; and there is also a
confirmation by the King‚ dated March 10, 1315 (Pat. Eone,
Edw. 11.‚ pt. 2, m. 27). See N 0. 103 in the Appendix.

21. WILLIAM V,—Twenty-first in Burton’s list stands Abbot
william, and before his name is the date “June 1318.’' As
authority for this an entry in Archbishop Melton's Register is
cited, p. 228. My own reference is to fo, ccxxviib. The entry
isin the usual form, but subjoined is the following memoran-
dum z—-“ F actae fuerunt istoe professiones et benedictiones in
Capella de Burtona prope Beverlacum, die Dominica proximo
post festum S. J ohannis Baptistae, A. Gr. Mccc decimo octavo,
et Pontificatus Domini Willelmi de Melton primo.” This same
Abbot william is a party to the Conventio with William de la
Broc and his wife, Eleus, which is the subject of the original
