noster,” and was it not possible that he, when he found he
could not heal the breach, might take the next best step
in his power, and, in conjunction with Prior Waltheof and
the influential friends and allies of the latter, countenance,

peace might be restored to the Convent by the removal
of one of the dissentient bodies? And this is an hypo-

Augustinian Priory as well. It is quite possible that
some among the body might join the Cistercian order,
but the inference from all we know, and can legitimately
infer, is that peace was restored to the Convent, and it
was enabled to persevere in the old tracks.¹

One consideration must have presented itself to the
mind, and perhaps more than once, during the course of
the preceding discussion—I mean that, although both of
the charters‚ which we have had to notice more or less
in detail, are spoken of or described as Charters of

that such a description must be considerably qualified
before it becomes applicable to such documents as they
in reality are. Our conclusions as to their several dates
are such that they can neither bc qualified nor gainsaid.

It is indisputable that the earlier of the two postdates
