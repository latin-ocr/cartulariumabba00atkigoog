¹ The boundary here given in one
the general run of which in per·
hapa, on the whole, fairly easy ιο
make out. And yet on trying to
make out ite details it ia found ιο be
bezet with manifold difficulties and
perplexitiee. It is impossible ιο
give the questions involved adequete
consideration in the present eeriee of
notes ς but an attempt will be made
ιο deal with them in a manner more
or lese adequate in the Introduction.
Of that of the entire boundary
involv by the stream ιο the name
of which this note ie appended, it
ma at leeet be naid that it ie alto-
⁸⁰2²{12‘5123‘ *εὲ fflssffiz ιω.

o e rece o

name has rew ed the search made
for it. And unfortunately there
ffisstssiicffifflffiffiyoinrlffl
however quelified in nome one par1
ticular or more, hee necessarily ιο be
made. One remark, however, it
neema requisito tomke in connection
with Tecriueling—aeeuming that to
be the correct reading of the neme:
it might be Tacrineling—and thet is
that Allereton Beck and Tecriueling
are cleerl intended ιο re renent or
denote t e eastern an western
limite of the grant or grente involved.
This will stand out more evidently
if we refer to the document contain-
ing the fulleet delineation of the
boundary under notice, and that ie
No. 001„ or Henry the Second’s
Charter of confirmation, which, so
ιο tpeak, consolidatos the mus oi
chartere which go ιο the completion
of the grant of the ‘⁸ Ventum subtus
Pickeringam.” The document re·
ferred to, after noticin that the

formally πνοι-ιι ιο by the Wepentake
of Pickering-Lith‚ goee on to specify
ae follows :—“ scil„ quicquid eet in-

that the boundnry ie coincident with
the Costa from ite confluence with
the Rye ae fer ee Tacriueling, and
that then it deviates from the water-
line hitherto followed, and threede

thread of water, or e longitudiml

within the range of probability that
Tacriueling was near what ie now
