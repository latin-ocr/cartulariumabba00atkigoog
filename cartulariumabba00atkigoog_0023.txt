XX INTRODUGTION.

Without counting the duplicate just now referred to,
there are in the Rievaulx Chartulary iteelf five principa]
documenta connected with Kirkham. There are the
two Fundatione3‚ the indenture or agreement, and two
shorter pieces headed “ Carta de Kirkeham de decimisss’
and “ Carta de Kirkaham secunda 3 '⁹ ¹ and itis from these
documenta that euch inductione must be made as are
reasonably poesible.

In the first place, Ι would remark that neither of the
documenta ticketed with the label “ Fundatio '’ can in
any true sense be regarded as the original foundation
deed at all.²3 For although they differ in date, and
perhaps by from five to seven, or even eight yearS, yet
the earlier of the two poetdates the foundation of
Rievaulx. For in the said earlier of the two Fundatio
documenta there stands thie decisive sentence :—“ Et
pro decima quinque carucatarum de Tilleetona, 'et pro
decima quatuor carucatarum de Grif, et pro omnibus
quae Canonicie pertinebant, quoe modo habent Α bbas ct
monachi RievallenseS, donavi eie meum purprestum de
Kircham, et domos meae, et molendinum, et prata mea,

¹ There are, besides, reheareale
or recapitulatione of some of theee
piecee, but 1 with to be understood
ae speaking only of the original

² It may be remarked that in the
Cartala-rium iteelf greater reticence
or cantion in the description of the
deede mentioned ie very ohservable.
Thus the first of the two copies (No.
oexvx.) of what ie labelled by Dode-
worth ae “ Secunda fundatio de
Kirkham,'‘ ie simply heeded with
“Trmecriptum carto de Kircham,”

while the indentur-e or agreement
(No. cxux.) is noted ae “cyro-
graphum inter noe et Kirkehm. '⁹
What ie in reality the final settle·
ment of endowment by Walter
Eepec ie derived from nod-worth
(rx. fo. 157), and ie headed “Fun-
datio Menanterii de Kirkham in
Com. Ebot-acensi,” but whether that
heading is a part of the document
iteelf, or merely a title prefixed
by the copyist, there is no meane
of deciding, any more than there
ie of detor-mining from what source
the naid copyist obtained it.
