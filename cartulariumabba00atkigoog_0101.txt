was succeeded by William de Punchard, who dies from three
to four years later. There is no room, therefore, for Abbot
Godfrey, if there were an Abbot so named, until some time in
12033 and 111 1204, according to the extract from the Meli-ose

“Chronica'' given a little above, it is stated that an Abbot
named Gaufridus (or Geoffrey) became the ecclesiastic-al head
of the House. Clearly then it must be assumed, not only that
it is out of the question to insert an Abbot Godfrey between
sylvanus and Ernald, or between Ernald and William de
Punchard‚ but that the only possible supposition is that the
Abbot called Godfrey in the accredited lists of Abbots of
Rievaulx must be identical with the Abbot called Gaufridus
by the Melrose Chronicler, and that his proper placc in the
catalogue is immediately in succession to William Punchard.
But to return to Abbot Ernald, He begins his rule as Abbot
2d March 1 1893 and in the next place, in his catalogue of the
Ptiors of Wartre, Burton mentions Yvo as the fourth (with
the date 1132 printed by mistake for 1192), and in 1118 note
thereto adds, --‘ ‘Ivo de Wartre occurs Prior in Δ111). 1192,
being cotemporary with Ernald, Abbot of RievaL and william,
Prior of Kirkham, in the first year of the pontificate of Pope
Celestine the Thu-d.” Abbot Ernald' s name occurs also among
those of the witnesses to a charter by Bishop Pudsey, together
with that of Abbot william of N ewmmster (Archbishop Gray’ 8
Register, S..S p. 39 11..) For 1199 as the date of his resigna-
tion of the office of Abbot, and for the fact of the resignation
itself, Burton quot-es 0122 on. de Mailros, p. 181. But there is
in the same record another entry which contains what is
unquestionably a reference to Abbot Ernald, which is not
altogether free from obscurity. It is on p. 180, and runs
thus :--“ Anno Mcxciv, Dominus R[einerius], vii. Abbas de
MelroS, curam pastoralem sigillo suo Abbati E[rnaldo] de
Rievalle humiliter assignavit, scil„ xv Kal. OctobriS, i.e. Sabbat03
cui successit Radulphus, Abbas de Kinlos.” Fr0m the date,
there can be no hesitation about completin g the name, the
initial of which only is given3 and the inference appears to be
that the Abbot of Rievaulx was the person specially deputed
to receive the formal resignation of the retii-ing prelate.
