on the other side of the Rye is not coincident with
the mid-stream line, as is the almost invariable rule
in such 00000, but deviates therefrom, and, so to say,
eneroaches on the Byland side. These “ 0110100011-
ments ” in reality constitute the land accruing to the
Abbey in virtue of the concessione made by the By-
land community, confirmed by the Malbis uncle and
nephew, in furtherance of the monks' scheme of the
“ guteria,” conduit or canal. And the unmistake-
able traces of the canal-—indeed the very course
and bed of the canal itself, as well as these encroaeh-
ments—remain to explain the chamere, as the charters
are endowed with a power to explain the deviatione
and the long deep canal-bed, in a way and with a
clearness that could in no a priori way have been
foreseen.¹

definite 11100 of what was meant by

idea of any “insula” beyond what
might have been in the possibly less
restricted river-bed of seven hundred
