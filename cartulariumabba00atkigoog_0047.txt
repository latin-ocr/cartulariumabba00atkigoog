Constrained as I have felt myself by the circum-
stances of the case to speak with the caution or reserve
qualjfying the preceding paragraph, it 16 not without
diffidence that Ι proceed to offer the following facts and
considerations for a measure of attention. Ι have
noticed in a brief note on page 1 6 that throughout the
Museum Ms. cartularium the Founder’s name is invari-

I might have added that the same rule prevails 111 all
the authentic early writings in which he is named. As
to precisely when the form L’Espec was introduced, or
why, I am not in a position to make any assertion; but

look upon as an innovation on the old mode of spelling
the name is certainly later by more than a century,

the foundation of Rievaulx Abbey. The original form
is certainly Espec and not L’Espec. Now, here let me

in 1135, in the presence of Walter Espec himself,
Geoffrey de Trailli, and all Walter’s other nephews
still living, confirms Espec's foundation grant to
Wardon Abbey in the following terms :—“ Scitote me
