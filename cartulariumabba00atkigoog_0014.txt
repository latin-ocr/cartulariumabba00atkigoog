sequence, and finding “ religione consolation ” in the
founding and endowing of the three monasteries named,
is in any respect one to be depended upon. When
we turn to the second and final so-called Endowment or
Foundation Oharter of Kirkham, we find the souls of
the fathers and mothers of the Founder's nephews men-
tioned, as also those of all their fore-elders and benefac-
tors, and those of all the faithful dead, mentioned, but
no reference to the· son of whom he had been bereaved.
Should we examine the corresponding clause of the so—
called F oundation Char-ter of Rievaulx, what we meet
with is thought of the salvation of the dead King william,
of the living King Henry, and of all their ancestors 3 of
that of the Founder's father and mother, of Hugh de
Wildecher, of that of his wife's father and mother, and of
all their fore-elders and ancestors in common, but no
hint even—not even so much as that in the phrase “ all
the faithful dead '' in the Kirkham deod—of a lost and
lamen ted child, grief for whose removal had inspired
and led to both the one foundation and the other.

I knOW, of course, that this is not a conclusive
consideration, and that, if dwelt upon too much, it
might prove a very broken reed indeed to rest upon.
But what is to me much more conclusive is that in the
earliest and, undoubtedly, most authentic statements
relative to Walter Espec we have, no mention is made
of an heir that had been, but was gone, no possible or
even latent suggestion that he had ever been a father.
The account referred to is printed in the M onastico‘n
(vi. 209), and is headed, “ Ε Libello Alredi Rievallensis
Athana, de Bello Standardico (Lelandi Collect„ vol. ii.
