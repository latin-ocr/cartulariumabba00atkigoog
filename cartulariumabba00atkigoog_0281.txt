² 'rho modern form of this name
is Wooddale beck3 and it. is note·
worthy that in another part oi the
same district, about six miles dis·
tant north-east, the same mediaeval
name is corrupted into the same
medem form— to be sure, with
diversities of spelling. Ι refer to
Wooddale, near Stonegate‚ which
in the Brus Partitio is written

Ulvdale.

² A manifest corruption of Ποε-
thwaith or Hogtwaith. Its site may
be determined by that of the farm-
stead known as Thwaites or Waites
Hense, near Wooddale House in
Westerdale Head, and about two
miles north of Esklits.

⁸ The source or origin of the river
Esk. It is close on the boundary
line between Farndale East and
Westerdale. The termination is
doubtless closely connected with
Wclsh lla· (in the plural uit) a h,
flood, stream. The word is ound
in more than one place in local

names in this northern district, and
among other instanoes one is found
not far from Rievaulx itself.

⁴ In addition to the two local
Ulfdales or Wolfdales noticed in a
preced‘ note, there is, on the
moorlan rid el 'ng between Great
Fryup and an y, and not more
than three to four miles east of
VVooddale in Westerdale‚ a hone or
grave-mound called wolfpit. In
this there is a large excavation of
a totally different aspect from the
cavities usually found in such hina,
and which are due to the non-
scientific openings made in search
of the supposed valuables contained
in the barrows. The name is oer-
tainly not of modern impositioni,
and it is now very many years ago
—1 daresay twenty years before

sources of information as the present
charior—that in a story Ι wrote for
