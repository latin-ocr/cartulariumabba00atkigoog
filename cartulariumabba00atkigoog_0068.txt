however rough even, from the haste with which it had
to be run up. And then we picture to ourselveS, per-

call them, that were run up within the year for the
reception of the Prior and his twelve canons from Kirk-
ham at their settlement in Lincolnshire. Or, perhap3,
we turn our pondering thought to the cyrograph between
Rievaulx and Kirkham, and refiect that if perchance
the various buildings specified therein were actually
completed within the year from the ratifying of the
agreement—a contingency absolutely contemplated in
one of the conditions specified toward the end of the
document—those several buildings, so precisely cata-

understand by the term “ substantial,’' and could never,
in any sense or in any part, have been the buildings
desig-ned to stand for good, and designed accordingly.1
