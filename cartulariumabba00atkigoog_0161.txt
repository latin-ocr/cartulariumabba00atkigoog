¹ The difficulties in the way of
identifying the place meant by this
name seem almost insuperable, and
are certainly disheartening. Hutton,
with the distinctive name “ le Hole ’²
attached to it, might seem to suggest
itself ς but on investigation the ides

able for this purpose are that it
was adjoinin on some part of the
boundaries o Kirkby Moorside —
being itself, it is to be resumed,
within the par-ish of Kir dale3 in
another direction on some part of
the boundaries of Fadmoor; and
elsewhere on the course of the stream
called Redofrs or Redover, which it
has been pro ed ιο identify with
the Hod e ck from the point
whereat t e said stream cesses to be
called Blswath Beck. Indefinite ss
this is, all beyond seems ιο be
totally uncertain. On the whole, it
will be better to abendon the attem t
to localise Houeton precisely—at
events for the present.

² The only name οιι the map any·
where near the vicinity indicated
that at all assimilatos itself to this
name is Wattelmoor. But it is
of no aveil for our purpose.

³ There seems to be no clue what·
ever of any tangible deseri tion, such
as to lead on to even any potheti-
cal identification of either t rs place,
Balbusch, or Aicwath. Robert de
Stuteville’s char-ter adds another un-
identifiable name, and apparently in
the close vicinity to these three,
namely, Jukeleholm. In close se·
quence it mentions also a place just
across the Redofra, connecting with
it a local reference to the north side
of Kirkdale Church. This adds s.
little, and but a little, to the assumed

approximate locality of Houetun.
