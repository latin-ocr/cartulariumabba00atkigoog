N OTES ΤΟ LIST OF ABBOTS.

1. WlmAM 1.—Abbot at the date of the Foundation3 be is
named in No, ccxxxw„ which is addressed to Henry 1., and
therefore antedates 1135. He is also named in No. XLIL,
which we have seen reason for thinking (see above, p. xxxvii.)
must be dated in 1145. william died 2d August 1145 (Chron.
Mailros, p. 72), as quoted by But-ton. The entry stands “ A⁰
Mcxhv. obiit willelmus, Abbas Rievallis, cui successit Mauri-
cius‚” on p. 166 of the copy I have collated.

2. Mammea—See the extract at the close of the last entry
and add :-—“ Praefuit pro eo (W illelmo) MauritiuS, a puero
educatus in claustro Dunelmensi monachus, et ad disciplinam
rigoris Cisterciensis‚ voto perfectionis, se transferens. Quo,
post modicum, officio abbatis eodem fervore perfectionis renun-
tiante, substitutus est pro eo Ethelredus Abbas, prae(e)minen-
tem gratiam in sermone sapientiae adeptus a Domino ''
(Hexham Book, p. 149: sub anno Mcxlv.). There is a matter
which presente itself for notice here, and calls for a measure of
attention. In Memorials of Fountains Abbeffi p. 4 n., Mr.
Walbran writes: “ The house (Rievaulx Abbey) occupied a
dignified position until the period of its dissolution3 and in the
lifetime of its first Abbot, William, the friend of St. Bernard,
who was succeeded by Waltheof, another friend of that illus-
trious man (Henriquez F ascio. S. Ordinis Oist., Lib. ii. p. 298),
and the celebrated Aelred, sent out the colonies of monks etc.”
And again, at p. 94 n., speaking of william, Earl of Albe-
marle, he says: ‘⁸ His kinsman, Waltheof, Prior of Kirkham‚
who had advised him to found the Abbey of Thornton‚ became
indeed so much imbued with the Bernardine spirit as ulti-
mately to j0in that body, and was successively Abbot of
Rivaux and Melrose 3 but five years before Vaudey was
founded, when the Earl entered the Chapter-House at York,
as bearer of King Stepben’s command that Fitz-Herbert should
be elected Archbishop of that See, he found Prior Waltheof
and the assembled Cistercians among the opponents, for whom
he had so little respect as to capture and confine certain of
them shortly after, in his castle of Bitham.” As on the pre-
ceding page it is stated that Vaudey was founded in 1147, the
date of the transaction thus recorded is 1142, at which time
Waltheof was still Prior of Kirkham. There can also be little
doubt that in 1 145, and for some little time after—though for
