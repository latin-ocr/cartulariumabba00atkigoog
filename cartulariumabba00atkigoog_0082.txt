INTRODUGTION. lxxvii

the nascent Abbey. And, as subsequent to Stephen's
reign, or during the strong reign of Henry‚ it is more
than merely difficult to think of such spoliation as Rie-
vaulx unquestionably was exposed to as taking place
in entire disregard‚ or even defiance, of the will and
power of the King. And this consideration is entirely
unsuggested by, and independent of, the further con-
sideration that, in the case under notice, the appeal for
justice is made to the Pope and not to the King. The
fact is certainly significant, and it may possibly be looked
upon as a suggestion towards an attempt to read between
the lineS‚ and thereby decipher an appeal to the Apo-
stolical See, as to a court of last resort, against the King,
as well as against the inj urious barons and other donors,
or their representatives And this recalls to our recol-
lection that there was a time in Henry's history when
precisely such an appeal, and an appeal, moreover, in
which the interests of Rievaulx Abbey might be vitally
affected, might very well have been made. Thus, at
the Council of N orthampton‚ many charges were brought
against the Archbishop (Becket) ; his life was even said
to be in danger3 he was condemned in a large sum for
alleged mismanagement of the King’s treasure while
yet Ohancellor: he not only announced his intention
of appealing to the Pope, but left Northampton by
night (October 13, 1164), and left in disguise. After
a brief stay in Kent, he proceeded, by way of Grave—
lines, to Pontigny‚ a Cistercian House in France, where
he found an asylum, and from whence he conducted
the earlier part of the struggle with the King, of which
the Chronicles are so full for the next half dozen years
