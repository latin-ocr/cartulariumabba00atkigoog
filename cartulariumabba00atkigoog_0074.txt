INTRODUGTION.

lxxi

The grant was not altogether gratuitous on the part
of Hugh Malbis‚ as will be observed on inspection of
No. LXXV„ the phrase being “ut autem hanc elemosinam
libentius facerem dederunt mihi monachi xx s, pro cari-
tate.'’ Ι t was “ elemosina,'' but elemosina for which a
consideration had to be given.

in the direction in which 1 was quite
anre the Bangendebridge must be
looked for. But of course a dam of
the character in question, sufficiently
high and strong to head back the
water of Rye, so that it might
sctuslly flow beck to the foot of
Rievsulx site—and hence the neces·
sity for that which was contemplated
in the phrase “quam propius montem
potuerunt ” — could not be mede
effectusl for its intended purpose if
any low, wesk, or broken places
presented themselves in either bank
between the dam and the building-
site. And it is hardly necessary to
observe that, while the monks could
do what was necessa-ry in the wey
oi embmkment‚ or what not, on
their own side, on the other they
were poma-less, apert from the
special permission of the possessor,
and the privilege secorded by him
of raising the necessary embsnk-
ments, wherever needed, on his side
also. And hence origineted the
being es well ss the occasion for the
aserenam encroschments, esch of
which cen heve been nothing else
originally than the site of sn em-
bsnkment designed to keep the
water of the river from escaping
there, md so defesting the very end
end object of the dam, besides over·
flowing end wasting all the low-
lying or holmlsnd adjacent. But
even this is not all. In the course
oi the second day of these investige-
tions Mr. Rye remarked‚ ss the

part-y was passing a given point, and

ὰ propos of s piece of river-side
meedow·lsnd—“ This field is stin
named The Islsnd.” The meaning
end the applicetion of the neme was
now a. matter of easy deductiori.
When the cansl, wide enough and
deep enough to permit the passage
of stone-leden lighters or berges,
had been in existence, all the low·
lying or river-side land between the
Rye and the “guteria” hed been
practically an island3 and as Ι had
already seen in the course oi the
earlier part of the morning, when 1
had had the opportunity—lasting
only about half sn bour, unlnckily*—
oi looking st some of the earlier
entries in en old survey of the Dun-
combe Park estate, a very consider·
able number of what were designated
⁶ ⁸ beust-gates ’' were then—s century
end half before, at least‚—lotted out
in “ the Islend.'’ 1 would only edd
further here, thet this “guterius”
or cansl was that which was de·
signed snd constructed in connec-
tion with the trmsport of the stone
which was used in the second or
later building epoch of the two under
comment. The quarry worked for
the stone in question hed become
svsilsble to the monks in virtue oi
the grant printed as No.1.xnv.,
sud the expansion of that end of the
“guter-is? amounting in realityto

a kind of basin for the reception of
the flate or lighters employed in the
transport, is still perfectly end easily
treeeable.
