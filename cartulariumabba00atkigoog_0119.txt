Mr. Hope's note pertinent to the “ Imago of St. Cristofer in a
tabernaclo sett between these two chapels ” (p. 336) is, “ Itis not
clear whether this was in the transept or in the aisle 3 but I think
in the transept in front of the pier, which is somewhat cut about-'²

“ The western arch of the south aisle of the choir was screened 3
all three of the arches on the east side of the north transept were
partitioned off by screens as high as the capitale, as is attested by
the cuts which have been made there; and the arch from the south
aisle of the nave into the transept was filled with a wooden screen.”

Mr. Hope’s comment on the uncertain word in the sentence-

‘A place of three hows of tymber'' (p. 338)—is,‘ ‘was not this a
place of‘ three howse high: that' 1s, three storeys divided into com-
partments for books ‘l Perhaps they had a portable ladder instead
of a vicess'

“The ‘dortor’ (p. 339) of course extended southwards from the
transept over the Chapter-Hense, etc. As to the ‘ second dortor,’
the site is not quite certain. Probably over the buildings forming
the north side of the farmery cloister. Or it may have been the
domus necessaria or rere-dorter. Cf. the ‘ third dorter ’ at Canter-
bury. '³

Touching the Frater and its windows the remark is, “ The
number of these windows does not agree with what there was, and
actually still is; and nothing is said about the great undercroft
below the Frater.”

The Convent kitchen was on the west of the Frater, as at Foun·
tains, Tintern, etc„ and had a hatch to pass food through.

As to the “ Garnare on the west of the Oloyster '² (p. 340). · ‘⁶ The
building usually met with 1n this position is the great range found
at Fountains, Beaulieu, Byland, Kirkstall, etc„ assigned to the
conversi.. ‚Here they probably used as their dining- hall
the undet-croft of the Frater. But where did they lodge'l The

‘'garnare at Rievaulx is so narrow—less than twenty feet—I
thought it might really be the ‘ lane ’ found at Oiteaux, Olairvaux,
and Pontigny; and, in England, at Beaulieu‚ Byland, and Kirk- ·
stall ς and originally, as Ι have discovered, at Fountains also 3 but
the windows and doors in the west wall seem to negative the
existence of a ‘ cellarium ' on the west of it ’³

Mr. Hope thinks that the‘ ‘house for evidence” was somewhere
near the chapter· h-ouse, and as ιο* t‘he long house between the
hall and the dorter,” he mquires. “Was this the great rere-dorter.
or the room over the north side of the farmery cloister'l’'
