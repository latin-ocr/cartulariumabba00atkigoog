granted a lease of lands in Pickering Marrishes to Robert
Hunter. In Nc. 873, much of which is illegible, he is recorded
as having leased to william, Prior of Bridlington, certain lands
called Campe and Twillynge‚ otherwise Twyndill.

35. EDWARD. -This Abbot’s name is not mentioned by Bur-
ton, and therefore by none of his copyists. His name is found,
together with that of Briau Higdon, appended to the Status
Monasterii de Fontibus», printed ιιι Memor-iate of Fountaim, at
p. 288 et oeq.; and ιιι the note on p. 296, Mr. Walbran states
that he had not been able to ascertain how long or when the
Abbot Edward presided.'' He is, however, repeatedly named
in the Conventual Leases, beginning with N 0. 87 2⁸, which is
dated 20th J anuary, 1530. N 0. 889 is another lease by the
same Abbot, granted in 1531. No, 896 is a grant by him toone
George Coottes of the office of Conventual swineherd, dated
ιιι 1532 ; and N ο. 883, dated May 24, 1503, is a lease granted by
him of land in the Marrishes. But there is much more than this
to be said touching this Abbot, this being, perhaps, the most

as he does, the thirty· fifth in our list. Ι hardly need ad—
vert to the current tradition—for at present, in some of its
aspects‚ it is little more—that an Abbot of Rievaulx, no name
being specified, was concerned in the Pilgrimage of Gracc, and
was in consequence executed for high treason. As an instance
of the way ιιι which this matter is dealt with by those who
compile what they call “ history ’' of what is styled the “ local”
sort, without taking the slightest trouble about authenticating
the statements they make or repeat, I quote the following from
Giu’s Valli-³ Eboracemia p. 312: “In 1536 an insurrection
broke out in the northern counties, which was headed by the
Archbishop of York and several of the nobles, This move-
ment was called the‘ Pilgrimage of Grace,’ the banners of the
insurgente being painted with the image of Christ crucified,
and the chalice and host, the emblems of their saith. The

rebellion, though somewhat formidable, was soon put down;
and the· leaders of the insurgente, among whom was the Abbot
of Rievauh, were apprehended and executed for high treasonl’
Τιιο insurrection ιιι question took place early 111 1537, when
Rowland Blyton, who lived to surrender the Abbey m the ’follow-

alleged leadership of the alleged Abbot of Rievaulx. But let
that pass. That there was an Abbot of Rievaulx condemned
