precise in quoting the whole passage that we may be
the better enabled to compare it with the countervail-
ing extract from No, ccchv11., or what Ι have spoken
of above as the second and final Endowment Charter.
What wc find there is as is here given: “ Sciatis nos

called for—of these extracts from these two charters
is aboundingly sufficient to show not only that one of
them is later than the other, but that, as regards Kirk-
ham‚ the second of the two is the latest and the final
one. But we may go a step further yet. The first of
the two charters dates itself, as we have seen, subse-

second, as addressed to Archbishop Thurstan and Bishop
Geofl'rey of Durham, who were contemporaries in their
several dignities only from 1133 to 1 140, must take
date within that interval of six or seven years, and
probably towards the latter limit of it.

Kirkham as given in this second or final charter. In
the first place, we note the full grant of the Kirkham
