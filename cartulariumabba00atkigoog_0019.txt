is easy to speak of the “ various and conflicting motives
that originatcd the foundation of religious houses,'' and
to suggest “ conscience-stricken pangs that were com-
fortably to be stifled by the bestowal of a superfluity
which eost the giver nothing,'' the “ death-bed conces-
sions that were to cha-tter a seat in heaven by a foregone
inheritance in earth,'’ ² “ the operation of domestic grief
on superstition,’' and the like: but the question really
is whether such suggestion is very much better than a

species of clap-trap.

1 prefer the tone and spirit of the

man who, although he is not an enthusiastic apostle of
the religion of Christ, yet recognises in the life of
Bernard of Olarcvallis “ the greatness of the place he

dred snd fifteen monasterie· were
built during the nineteen years of
Stephen’s reign, more then had
been founded in the whole previous
century; s hundred and thirteen
were added to these during the
reign of Henry. In half-a-century
ditty-four religione houses were built
in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire alone.
Monestery end priory . . . towered
above the wretched mud-hovels in
which the whole of the population
below the class of berone crowded.
. . . We may gain some faint idea
οἱ the amazing stir and industry
which the founding of these mones·
teries implied, by following in our
medem ferme and pastum-landis the
traces which may even now be seen
of the toil of these great preechers
of labour. The whole water-supply
of s, countryside for miles round was
gethei-ed up by vest dreinsge works3
stagnant pools were transformed into
running wsters closed in by embenk-
ments, which still serve ss ditches
to the modern fermer3 swsmps were
reclaimed thet ere only now pre-
served for cultivation by maintain-

ing the dykes end chmels first cut
by mediaevsl monks3 mills rose on
the banks of the newly-crented
stresmsg rosds were mede by which
the corn of the surrounding villages
might be carried to the central mm,
and the produce of the land brought
to the central storehouse. The new
settlers shewed s messureless cun-
ning and industry in reclsiming soil
hitherto worthless.” As the soberly
arrived-et conclusione of one of the
most competent historicnl inquirere
of our day, ⁸11 this is surely w'cll
worthy of attention. But, may we
not ssk, were the results thus stated
alike unintended end unnnticipsted
both by founder end1donor, and
scarcely even forecasted by the
monkish settlers themselves 2 For
something approaching to thet would
be the conclusion we should be forced
upon if we accept the customary
claptrap sentimentslism about the
preveiling motiva, ss assumed, of
the great originators of many or
most of our most famous religione
houses.
