to certainty, that Sproxton, Harum, Stonegrave (or at
least parts of the ville so named), and the lande held
by the Surdevals, Lenveisets, Luvels, and others, his
“ homines,'’ mentioned in this charter of endowment, or,
more casually, in other deeds, were certainly appendages
of his great fies. But even in saying as much as this,
elements of uncertainty are already introduced, and our
only resource still left is to try and puzzle out painfully
and doubtingly what may have belonged to him, inasmuch
as we hear of it as a part of the possessione of the heirs
of his sistere, which may possibly, perhaps sometimes
probably, have come to them from their great ancestor
Walter Espec.¹

¹ It would scarcely be expedient,
and it is surely anneceesnry to
occupy epam in a chapter of the pre·
sent kind with an inquii-y and investi-
getion of the nature thus indicated.
But it my not be altogether ined-
miesible to edvert in a note to some
of the results of e. very brief and
imperfect attempt of the kind in
question. In ee few words ss cen
be conveniently employed, and in-
clusive of the number of cernentes
specified ee extant in the two doubt·
ful phces, it may be stated that the
extent of the fees in the possession
of Walter Espec in the places in
such perte of the county oi York-
shire ae are immediately concerned
by his mnia, or by the subices of
his “mem” or the direct inheritence
of hin descendente (limiting the
period to the end of the thirteenth
century), must have reached to 135
maestes at the least. And another
statement that may be ventui-ed
is that, of this very considerable
area», ι very considerable proportion

self, or of his thanes, or, end most
largely, the Earl of Mortein. Thus,
in the ville of Sproxton and Griff

Tileton, Helmsley, md Harum the
King and the Earl held between
them fifteen carucatee3 in Kirkham,
Thixendale, Howshem, Whitwell,
Gerton, Stonegrave, Pockley and
Beadlmm the Earl had no less then

Westow‚ in dependenciee of which
the King held six cernentes, if not
eight, md Barthorpe in Acklnm,
where the Eerl had six cernentes
more. And the importence of not
omitting these places in such en
enumerationi is seen very distinctly
from the following entry in Kirkby's
