catalogue the date 1224 is prefixed to his number and name,
his predecessor having died in 1223. “ Haec est finalis con-
cordia etc„ inter Rogerum, Abbatem Rievalh‘s, querentem, et
Ricardum de Sproxtona, deforciantem, etc.” (Feet of Fines,
1226). Nc. ccxvn. is a similar document, dated J anuary
1232, between Abbot Roger and William de Ros; No. cccle,
dated Pentecost 1233, is a lease of the Poketo Mill to N ew-
borough, bearing this Abbot's name3 in 1234 there is a F inalis
concordia between Abbot Roger and Robert le Bulur, with
Amabel his wife3 and yet again, there is another arrangement
of the same kind, dated in 1235, between the same Abbot and
Robert de Everingham and Isabella his wife, with interesting
details as to the property involved in the case, the document
being printed in the Appendix ; and lastly, in the Coram Rege
Pleas, Easter, 23 Henr. 111. (1233), Abbot Roget sues William
de Ros for warranty of the Grif and Tilston landa, and other
particulare of Espec's original grant He resigned in 1239
(Chr. de Mailros).

13. LEONIAS (LEONIUS).-“ Leonias de Dundraynon, a monk
of Melros'' is the entry in the Monasticon, with the date 1238
prefixed to the name, but without the usual citation of autho-

his accession to the Abbacy is “Anno MccxxxiX, Dominus
Rogerus, Abbas RievalliS, suo cessit officio, et Dominus Leonius
de Dundraynan, et monachus de Melros, successit? According
to the same authority (p. 203), he had been appointed Abbot
of Dundrennan' 1n 1236, the day before the feast of the Ascen-
sion; and, on the same page as stands the notice of his succes-
sion to the Abbot' s stall at Rievauht, is also the notice of his
death: “ Anno Mccxl, obiit venerabilis LeoniuS‚ Abbas Rie-
vanS, vi idus J anuarii3 cui successit, post Pascha, Dominus
Adam de Tilletai‚ Abbas.”

14. ADAM DE Tammi- Burton correctly (see last note)
prefixes the date 1240 to his mention of this Abbot. The same
date stands in No. chxxvnq while in Fines dated m that year,
and the following years, noted in the list, his name appears
ten times at the least. No. cccxxnl. is a fine dating' in 1257,
wherein Abbot Adam' is the plaintiff‚ and William deo Moubray
the defendant3 aud finally, No. cccxm, dated m 1260, gives up
his name as entering into a composition with the personage—
Simon de Vere—who was in reality one of the principals
