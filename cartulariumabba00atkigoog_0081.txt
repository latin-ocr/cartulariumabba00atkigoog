the facts just glanced at actually occurred. They seem
to be too marked not to have some connection with the
circumstances of the times. “ Between 1160 and' 1180,
and nearer the former date than the latter,'' is the in-
ferential conjecture ventured a little above as to the
time, and ventured solely on internal evidence. Between
1160 and 1 167 Aelred was Abbot, and next in succes-

exercise of justice ; and such expressions, even in such
histories of the time as can hardly be styled ‘⁶ popular ''
merely, as that “ Archbishop Thomas alienatcd the
whole party of the barons by pressing his demands for
the recovery of lands belonging to his see,'’ are not only
not uncommon‚ but are indices besides to the multi-

period when these plunderings were rife, Rievaulx could
not have been affected save in a negative kind of way.
It is indeed possible that the lawlessness of the times
induced Espec to hold his hand, in the way of further
endowment, from 1131 to 1145 3 but that is the utmost
extent to which that lawlessness could have affected
