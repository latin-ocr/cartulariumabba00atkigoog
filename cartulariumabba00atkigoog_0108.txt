25. WILLIAM vn.—1369. Patent Rous, 43 Edw, 111„ pt. 1,
m. 33. Exemplification touching the Pickering Manors. See
App. No. 98. “1372. Add. MSS. 4937, fo. 52. Sigillum
willelmi et Conventus Ryevallensis cuidam scripto appensum
dato apud Hamelak, die Veneris in crastino N ativitatis Β.
J ohannis Baptistae. Apud Belveir 19 August, 1732.” His
name is also met with in Patent Bous, 3 Rich. 11., pt. 2, m. 20,
as Willelmus nunc Abbati, xx die Februarii (1380). See No.
cchxxm„ p. 310.

26. W1LL1AM vnn—The date 1409 is inserted in the Mon-
asciam before the name of the twenty-third Abbot, william,

zprdnthe, authority quoted is “ Addenda to Tanner's Notitia, by
1 is.

27. WILLIAM IX.—Archbishop Bowet’s Register, pt. 2, p. 138,
quoted by Burt0n3 the date given being 18th Oct. 1419.
Bromley is given as this Abbot’s personal name.

28. J OHN 11.—Willis’ Histmy of AbbeyS, vol. ii. p. 28, is the
authority cited for this Abbot, whose name is found, as well as
that of his predecessor, in all the accredited lists.

29. HENRY 111.—“ Henry Bul-ton, a monk of Sallay‚'’ is the
accustomed way of noticing this Abbot, and the date, loth
Nov. 1423, is the date assigned, which depends upon an entry
in the Register at York, “ Sede vacante,'’ p. 321. Also see
No, cccvm„ a document dated the Feast of All Saints‚ 1429,
in which Henry is named as the then Abbot.

30. ἮΠᾸᾸΑΜ X.——Among the Conventual Leases, No. 876 is
an agreement between william, Abbot of Rivauhc, and Thomas,
Prior of Mount Gracc, touching Morton Grange in East Harlsey.
The date is Michaelmas 1436. “ Occurs in 1443 '' is Burton’s
note touching this Abbot, and he gives a reference to Arch-
bishop Kemp’s Register, p. 421. The entry there (my note is
p. 420b) is to the effect that John Inghelay was elected Abbot
of Rievaulx‚ on the resignation of William Spenser, in 1449.
This, while on the one hand it verifies the precise date at
which Abbot william ceased (by resignation) to be Abbot,
verifies also the fact that his personal name was Spenser,
This is a circumstance calling for specific remark, for, as will
be noticed more fully presently, the name of the Abbot who
succeeded John Inkeley or Inghelay was likewise william

Spenser.
