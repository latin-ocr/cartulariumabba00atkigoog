Dugdale and Burton, comprises thirty-one Abbots, who
are indicated in the subj oined list by the Roman
numerals in the second column. The numerals (Arabic)
in the first column indicate the number of the Abbots
who may be regarded as having actually presided over
the affairs of the Convent‚ and the succession in which
they came. Three names in the list, it will be observed,
are printed in italics. The first of these, Waltheof,

satisfy myself that they ever actually reigned, but I
have (as I think) satisfied myself that no such Abbots
could have possibly existed at the time alleged. It may

of thirty-two Abbots, the explanation being that after

list, but (equally with his predecessor, John 1.) omitted

even allowing for the exclusion of Walbran's Abbot
Waltheof‚ and the two who stand fourth and fifth in
the accepted catalogueS, the total number of thirty-six
authenticated Abbots still remains. At least, if there
