sharp reprimand (from “ Cromwell or one of his agents‚” as
Walbran suggests) to the Abbots of Byland and Fountains on
account of their delay in proceeding to fill the vacancy occa-
sioned by the said deposition, was despatched3 and in which
further, on December 6th, the newly-elected Abbot was for-
mally installed at the Conveni: Ghurch of Rievaulx3 the assig-
nation of the pension to the late Abbot dating—or rather being
reported as arranged—on May 7 th in the following year.

36. Rowmn.—-Burton calls the last Abbot Richard Blyton,
and Gill inserts the name as “ Richard (or Rowland de) Bly-
ton.’' However, there is no real uncertainty as to what his
name was. It occurs almost twenty times in Conventual
LeaseS, and always under one or other of the forms Roland or
Rowland. The earliest mention of him I meet with there is
in No. 894, dated February 26, 1534, and the latest in No, 885,
dated July 14, 1538. Nos. 893 and 871 are both dated in the

J une. But from what is said in the preceding note, it is clear
that he had been previously Abbot of Rufforth, and that his
election took place between the middle of November and the
6th December in 1533.

I have now but to express my sense of obligation to
all who have kindly assisted me in the compilation of
the present volume. To Lord Bolton especially am Ι
indebted for his great courtesy and kindness in giving
me access to the very interesting series of deeds con-
nected with the grants made to the Abbey in Wensley-
dale, the existence of which was not previously known ;
to Canon Raine for the loan of the instructive document
connected with the fabric of the Abbey at, or closely
after, the period of the Dissolution3 to ΜΓ. W. H. St. John
Hope for his most helpful annotations on the same ; and
above all, to Mr. William Brown of Arncliff Hall, for
almost invaluable help in not only in revising the proof-
sheets, but copying out for me not a few of the most
interesting, and at the same time the longest‚ of the
