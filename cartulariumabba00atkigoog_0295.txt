Savaric, Abbot of York, the first
Abbot Richard of Whitby, Prior
cuthbert of Guisborcngh, and Arch-
bishop Henry Mul-dac of York. The
letter was Archbisho from 1147 to
1153 (see Whitby rtulary, pp.
164, 165, and notes). There is then,
it is more than likely, a. ga in the
succession of Priore, for illium
Muschamp, ‘⁸ Prior de Kirkhame,”
in No. nvn„ is a contemporary of
Robert (Fures-n) de Ros, who had
livery of his lande, eto„ in 1190-1.
Again, in No. xnvm„ william, Prior
of Kirkhsm, is mentioned amon the
Testes. He is, no doubt, the il·
liam Muschamp of the preceding
charter. But there is a. Walter,
Prior of Kirkhsm, named in this
same Robert Fursan’s grant of Privi-
lege to the Burgeesee of Helmsley,
the date of which, Ι think, hes not
been ascertained. However, the
Grsntor died before Isso-7. There
is further a confirmation by william
de Ros, son of the aforesaid Robert
Fuman, of a grant b his father in
aid of a pitancia to t e convent, to
be enjoyed on the Feast of All
Sainte yearl , the first witness to
which is W· ἐπι, Prior of Kirkham.
This may be the william just pre·
viously noticed. And there is a. yet
further Prior william, whose neme
occurs once and again (as will be

noted in the s uel) about the eu·
1280, a. little be ore and a little .
Yet another Prior, nnmentioned in
Burton's list, will be met with below,
and in two placen but u in either
instance the mention ie made in a.
confirmation only, there is more of
the indefinite, es regards date, than
even in the cese of en undated
charter. Robert FitzThomas Baro
de Graistoke, confirma to Rievanlx
