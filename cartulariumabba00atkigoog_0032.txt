The name of the Prior who stands third in the list
thus supplied of course answers the question, Who was
the Prior at the time? and Wallevus (or Waldevus) is
but another and Latinised form of Waltheof, the name
of one who was kinsman to the earl of Albemarle¹ as
well as prior of Kirkham. And as such he stands forth
a man honourable by consanguinity, able besides—and
for the selfsame reason—to command the aid of
competent and important auxiliarios in any “ church-
extension ’' work—as it was understood then—well and
wisely organised, as it was sure to be in such hands.

And now the question ariseS, Was this scheme, of
the reality as well as the nature of which we are assured
by this cyrograph or agreement of cession between the
two Houses of Rievaulx and Kirkham, nullified or frus-
trated by the act-ion of Prior Waltheof in taking the
part he did in heading ² the colony of canons who went
to oecupy the new Priory at Thornton‘i

This issan inquiry which would be less complicated,
and involved in less obscurity, if we had clearer and
more definite information as to the circumstances of the
arrangement between the monks of Rievaulx and the
canons of Kirkham; if we knew exactly not only what

twelve canons, without himself, on
such a. mizdon, would have been an

those of the Testes to char-tere of

that period. He is, no doubt, the
william to whose name is prefixed
the number 2 in Burton's list, with

the incomplete “ Betwixt 1190,

imperfect number. The inference,
therefore, certainly is, that on leaving
Kirkham he purposed beeoming him-
self the first head of Thornton‚ and
that his making Richard the first
Prior simply impliee that he changed
his mind and returned to Kirkha.m‚
where, we have no reason to doubt,
he remained Prior for several years,
six or seven at least.
