THE sURTEEs soofflTY.

 

REPOR'I' FOR THE YEAR MD.OOO.LXXXV111.

Smer: the last Report was issued, the work of the Surtees
Society has been uneventful. The List of Members shews
that it rests upon a firm basis, including as it does ‚more
than one hundred libraries and public institutions. The
Council have had no occasion to regret' fiheir defierminafiion
to limit the number of Subscribers bo 350.

Of fihe original Members of the Society who were elected
more than half a century ag0, Dr. Whifiley is the only
survivor, whssst not many more than a dozen remain of those
who joined us during the first fiwenty years of our exist-
ence. Such changes are inevitable. We are very proud of
the loyalty of the great· majority of our Members. In very
many cases Membership has lasted for a life, and then the
son has taken the place of his father.

Since the last Report was issued‚ the Oorrespondence of
Dr. Stukeley, and the Memorials of Ripon‚ in two volumes,
have been concluded. We have also brought out a second
volume of Yorkshire Diaries, and a fifth volume of that most
valuable work, the Testamenta Eboracensia. The last three
works which we have issued are conspicuous for their
variety as well as for their infici-est. They comprise a volume
of ancient Ohurchwardens’ Accompts, which may serve
as a sample of a vast quantity of documents of fihe same
class3 the Chartulary of the Abbey of Rievaulx in Yorkshire,
famous for its romantio position as well as for its histor53
and, lastly, a selection from fihe Halmote Court Rolls of the

Prior and Conveni, of Durham, in the fourteenth {entur-y.
