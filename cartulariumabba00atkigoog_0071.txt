or deduction, is one which involves circumstances and
considerations of no ordinary interest.

There are charters, or rather a sequence of charters,
which, per se, are in many respects almost unintelli-
gible. They speak of a dike (fossatum) or dikes, of
apparently small but mysterious grants in connection
therewith, of a quteria, of an insula, where no ‘⁶ insula ’⁹
exists nom and where not one inquiring visitor in a
thousand would ever suspect, or, it may be said, has ever
suspected, the being of an “insula,” or island, in any
sense. And yet the fossata, the guterio„ and the site
of the “insula '’—an “ insula '' no longer—not only
exist, but, while explaining these otherwise mysterious
documentS, hang themselves on to the history of the
contrasted kinds os building-stone noticed a few sen-
tences above. One of these charters, from the identity
of the grantor no less than from the names of the wit-
nesseS‚ would, under any circumstances, date itself
approximately about the middle of the twelfth century.
This is N 0. LXXV. But there is another which is more
specific still, as being granted not only in the time of
King Stephen, but during the lifetime of william, the
first Abbot of Rievaulx, by the Abbot and Convent
of Byland, conceding to Rievaulx the privilege of mak-
ing their fossatum below what was then called Mons
Eschebcrch and now Ashberry Hill, as well as the right
of ownership of the slip or slips of land which might
be enclosed between the fossatum and the river. The
charter in question is printed as Nc. cchIV. This
dates the quteria as ante 1145. Other two, Nos. ccc.
and CCOIV. are fixed as to date between 1193 and 1203,
