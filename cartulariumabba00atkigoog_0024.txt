et omnia quae habui inter boscum et aquam, et pisca-
tionem de aqua de Kircham et de Husum.” ¹ If, then,
we accept the usually received and accredited dates of
the several foundations of the one house and the other
——namely, 1122 for that of Kirkham, and 1131, 1132,
or 1 133 ² for that of Rievaulx—and, so far as appears,
there is no valid reason, if any at all, alleged for reject-
ing them, it is absolutely clear that this so-called Foun-
dation Char-ter is from ten to twelve or fourteen years,
at the least, later than the actual foundation of the
Priory itself.

But it will be well to show that the allegation, that
the charter under special notice is the later of the two,
does not rest upon a mere ipse dixit. There is no
question, Ι think, that at the dissolution the Priory of
Kirkham was de sacto owner of Kirkham in its entirety,
that the whole township ⁸ of that name was in the
hands of the monastery. In Nc. ccxvn, however,
Walter Espec grants as follows :--“ Ecclesiam de Kir-
cham, cum una carucata terrae, et omnibus eidem
ecclesiae pertinentibus ς . . . et in Kircham viginti
quatuor acras terrae quse sunt inter boscum et aquam
de Derewenta‚ et meum novum gardinum, et mansuram
quam Radulfus Presbyter ibi habuit. Etiam proprii
porci canonicorum ibunt in boscum meum de Kircham

us of fixing the date of the chartei· to deal more specially with that par-
