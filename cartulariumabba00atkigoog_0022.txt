hardly have anticipated. Thus, in Dodsworth, No. IX.
fc. 161, is copy of the document which finds a place
twice in the Oartularium, and is printed hereafter as
N 0. ocxvl„ with the heading—“ Ex chartulario Rievallis
in Com. Ebor. in Bibliotheca Cott. remanente, Id. J un.,
1622. Secunda fundatio de Kirkham. Transcriptum
Fundationis Prioratus de Kirkham.” The superscrip-
tion by that eminent collector, “ Secunda fundati0‚” is
suffi cient to show what was the thought present in his
mind, however far mistaken he was even as to the
relative date of the record he was engaged with 3 while
more recently a paper on Kirkham Priory has been re-
published‚ of which Ι can only think that had its able
and most painstaking author had the opportunity of
revising it, with the added knowledge and investigation
of the subsequent years of his diligent life, it would
have been recast as to the greater part of its historical
matter. But Ι would not for a moment have it under-
stood that, because Ι find mysels unable to accept some
of Mr. Walbran’s conclusions touching this “ indenture
or agreement between the monks of Rivaulx and the
canons of Kirkham,'’ or even in some instances to
indorse his statement of factS, it is my wish or my
purpose to derogate from his well-earned reputation for
careful and intelligent research, or undervalue the extent
and the results of his unexampled diligence and devo-
tion. Any thought or intention of that kind would be
put to silence and to shame at once, by the merest
reference to the singularly full, instructive‚ and interest-
ing volume of Memorials of Fountaim, for which the
Surtees Society is indebted to his brain and his pen.
