other.”

It does not appear to be certain where the “ great chamber,” the
‘⁸ three romye north thereof,'' the ‘⁸ parlour,'’ the ‘⁸ entry to the
ehureh chamber,” and the “ ehuroh chambel- '’ iteelf, were situate 3
bnt Mr. Hope seems ιο think that these five entriee all refer to the
rooms between the great hall and the chureh. The next entry,
however, touching the ‘⁸ abbottee dyning chamber,” is charaeta-ised
‘⁶ aa of great intereat, as showing that, at the last, the Abbot lived
in the farmery. That eottage ιο the east may be the ‘ abbottea
chappelL' although originally the sarmery chapel. The ‘ chapell
without the gate ’ still stands. There ie also one at Oroxden, and
one has aleo been found at Fountaine.”

CORREOTION OF A MISTAKE AS TO DATE.

MR. HRNRY ORDn-POWLETT hae very kindly pointed out ιο me
that 1 have been misled, not in aeeking ιο identify William le
Skrop, the grantor of the chartei· numbered CXLV& with the william
le Serope mentioned in the note, p. 97, but in my inferentia] dating
of the deed itself. He writes: “ 1 find Hugo, Rector of Branee-
peth‚ granted lande ιο Hem-y Serope, eon of William Scrope, in
1308, and mentioned in that connection in four different deeds
among the Bolton collection. Hugo de Ask, another of the wit-
neeees (ιο No. oxhv'.), ae 1 know from another Bolton deed, wae
alive in 1293, aa also Haseulphus de Oleseby, then Reeeiver of Rich·
mond. Robert de Tyndale, aleo, and william Ruddekyn were
both living at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the four-
teenth centurion? There would therefore be no question ae ιο
the impossibility of identifying Reginald Chubbe (aee note ⁸, p. 95)
with Reginald de Bolton‚ otherwise Reginald FitzWalter‚ who
must have belonged ιο an earlier generation.
