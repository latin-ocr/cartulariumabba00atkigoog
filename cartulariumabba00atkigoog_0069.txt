IN TRODUCTION.

But with all these musings and ponderings, we allow
for the erection of a choir of stone, however short, and

modern, so far as Ι am aware, gives
any word the least like ‘⁸ spuor,”
either in form or suggestion, taking
stone, squar-ed, or in any form, as the
signification intended; and it is sel-
dom indeed that a word is met with
so utterly isolated as that comes to·
But again, 2. Four important parts
of the conventual establishment
(besides the seven others specified
“ of some other material '’) are to be
constructed in “spuor,” and more
than only possibly within the year.
To build a church—and allowing
only for the cheir—for thirteen pro·
fessed brethren, besides conversi, and
allowing for the influx of so many
new-comere as are implied in the
sending out of so many drafts to
furnish new Abbeys elsewhere—and
chapter-house, dor-ter, and frater,
on the same scale, in hewn stone,
is simply impossible. The con·
struction on that wise of a small
parish church, under the existing
circumstances of a still only growing
community—say, such as is pre-
sented to our view and appreciation
in the almost contemporary cheir at
Lastingham—could not have been
effectually completed within such
limite of time. Taking these diffi-
culties into consideration, 1 feel my·
sels constrained to differ in view
with the authorities mentioned
above as to the probable meaning
oi “spuor‚” and in preference to
adopt the theory that the word in
question may be a connection—
possibly disguised by scribe or
copyist's mistake—of the old word
which has come down to us in
the form “span'' ‘⁶ Fyr sperris‚'’
“spari-ys de quercu,'’ “sperris de
abiete, ’' are familiar mediaeval terme,

and it is a matter equally familiar
that houses, churches, even castles,
were wholly or in part built of tim·
ber. ‘⁶ The use of wood for domestic
architectum long after this time,''-
the eleventh century—says Profes-
sor Freeman (Norm. Gon. ii. 606),

“ need not be dwelt upon, end there .

is abundant evidence of the use of
wood in fortification at this time
and later. . . . Stone was at this
time fast coming into use for do·
mestic, as well as for military and
ecclesiastioal buildings.” Previouely
then the material in use must have
been wood, or modifications depend-
ing on the use of wood- As an
illustration simply, let me advert to
Greensted church, constructed, as
there seems no reason to doubt, in or
about the year 1013, to receive the
body of St. Edmund. The entry in
a record preserved in the Monaetieon
is “ Idem apud Aungre (Ongar3
Greensted having been formerly
pareel of Ongar) hospitabatur, ubi in
ejus memoria lignea capella per-
manet usque hodie.” In my Eesex
boyhood this chapel of wood was
still the par-ish church of Greensted,
and this is the description z-“The
nave is formed of the half trunks of
oaks, about a foot aud a half in
diameter, split, and roughly hewu
at each end, tolet them into a sill
at the bottnm, and into a plank at
the top, where they are fastened
with wooden pegs. It is 29 feet 9
inches long, 14 feet wide, and 5 feet
6 inches high on the sides which
supported the primitive roof. On
the south side there are sixteen
trunks and two door-posts; on the
north twenty-one, and two vacancies
filled up with plaster. The west
