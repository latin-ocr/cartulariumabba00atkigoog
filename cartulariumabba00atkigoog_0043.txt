that I did then, adding to and enlarging the means for
good I devoted to the purpose at the outset.”¹

It will have, no doubt, been observed that three
successive years are named as the years of the founda-
tion of Rievaulx Abbey, 1131, 1132, and 1133. The
latter is the date quoted in the genealogy of Ros, which
is found on the fourth parchment leaf in the Cottonian
Cartularium (the substance of which is printed below in
the Appendix), where the statement stands—“ Walterus
Especke‚ miles strenuus Conquestoris„ tria fundavit
monasteria, I. de Kirkham, Ad). 1122; ΙΙ. de Rievall,
11333 III. de Wardon, 1136.” As regards the other
two years named, the following extract from the
Hexham Book (S. S„ p. 108) will serve as well as any
other that can be adduced to bring the matter fairly
before us—“ Anno Mcxxxii„ Walterus Espec, vir magnus
et potens in conspectu regis et totius regni, monachos
cisterciensis Observantiae, directos a Bernard0‚ Abbate
Clarae-vaIIiS, recepit et posuit in solitudine Blackhoumor,

² Itis quite true this view is not
without its difficulties. The most
apparent is the way in which King
Hem-y is mentioned in the preamble.
The obvious infer-enee seems to be
that both the King and his wife are
living as well as consenting parties.
Certainly it is stated that the
latter survived her husband, but
the King died in 1135, and in 1145
Stephon was king. But while it is
quite competent to us to accept the
“ concessu Henrici Regis Anglorum ”
in its historica-1 sense only, it must
also be remembered that by taking
it in the other sense we ignore the
direct statement in the MSS. quoted
to the effect that Bildesdale was
given in 1145, and not before. These

difficulties must be balanced. So
far as the witnesses are concerned,
while some of those named were
certainly still living in 1145, Ι (10
not know of any who can be identi-
fied as having passed away. And
although it was the last year of
Abbot William’s life, still he lived
to the 4th nones of August in it,
and there is something not unattrae·
tive, nor without its tinge of pa-
thetic sentiment, in the thought that
Espec's confirmation οἱ his first
grant, and further benefaction of so
important a character as the grant
of Bilsdale‚ was made to his old
friend on the eve of his approaching
departure to another and higher
sphere of duty and service.
