xcii INTBODUCTION.

presided over the Abbey. For the document which is printed
as No, ccmn. contains passages and dates such that the only
reasonable construction which can be put upon them, so far as
I am able to see, warrants the conclusion that Sylvanus was
Abbot as early as 11703 and if that is so, it is unnecessary to
dwell upon the certainty that the two Abbots inserted in the
list here could have had no existence at the dates alleged.
The document in question is headed, “ Cyrographum pacis
inter nos et Bellandense8‚’' and in the preamble speaks of an
arrangement made between the two convente through the
provident caution of the Abbots Aelred of Rievaulx and Roget

, of Byland. It then proceeds to notice in detail divers matters

which had been subjecte of controversy between the two
houseS, but were amicably settled by the Abbots named, with a
variety of conditione of a prospective nature, and connecting
themselves with different and widely separated portions of the
possessions belonging to the several comm unities in places
where they chanced to have a common interest, many of which
are alike interesting and instructive when the subJect for con-
sideration is the history of either of the two establishments
named. After this the document proceeds thus :·····“ Cum
autem haec conventio pluribus annis ab utroque in multis con-
servata fuisset, Α0 ab Incarnatione Domini Mclxx, ne tepes-
ceret caritas mutua, iterato replicata et arctius est roborata,
additis quibusdam quae in priore conventione non continebantur,
et hoc praecipue etc.‚” going on to specify certain claime by
either party (which were to be finally dropped from that day
forward)‚ and to provide a mode of mutual arbitration for any
occasions of dispute which might arise in the future. This
done, and the penalties for infraction of the rules laid down
provided, the document concludes thus :—“ Haec carta lecta est
in utroque Capitulo, praesentibus AbbatibuS, Domino Silvano
Rievallense et Rogero Bellandensi‚ et tam ab ipsis quam
utroque Capitulo in perpetuum confirmata.” After long and
patient consideration I find myself unable to dissever between
' the date thus given and this public reading over and common
ratification by the two Chapters of the Conventio or agree-
ment. And if so, our conclusion is that S lvanus was Abbot
as early as 1170. And admitting this, w ’ e on the one hand
the two dates quoted by Burton in connection with the alleged
Abbots‚ Roger and Bernard, are effectually set aeide, the
interval during which either of them, or both, could have pre-
sided, is narrowed to the period occurring between Aelred's
death in 1167, and the accession of Sylvanus, certainly before
1170. Burton gives 1189 as the year of his death, and as his
