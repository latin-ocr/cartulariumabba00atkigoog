monks of RievauX, is no more apparent to us than that
which induced the monks of Rievaux to meditate a
translation of their house in 1158—five years after the
death of their founder—to Stainton near the sea, mid-
way between Whitby and Scarborough—a fact not
generally known.’' In the absence of 'any notes or
memoranda by Mr. Walbran which might serve to
throw light upon the matter, it is hard to account for
what appears to be a series of gratuitous slips and
misapprehensions. In the first place, the Abbey actu-
ally parted with the Stainton grant to the King in the
year alleged as that of the “ meditated translation ” ε
“ Anno ab Incarnatione Domini Molviii, dedit nobis
Rex Hem-icus 11³⁸ vastum subtus Pikering, in escambio
pro Steintona‚ quam nobis dedit Walterus de Gant ad
abbatiam construendam.'' (See below, p. 261.) In the
second place, the Stainton in question was not the
“ Stainton by the sea ''—in other words Staintondale—
“ between Whitby and Scarborough.” That Stainton
appears to have been a part of the Terra Regis of
Domesday‚ and to have remained attached to the
Honour of Pickering Castle as long as it remained in
Royal or quasi-Royal tenure, and so could not have
been in the hands of the alleged donor of the land
which was given “ ad construendam abbatiam. '' And
again, in the third place, as given by Walter de Gant

(see N 0. cchxv111.), it must be looked for within the
limits of the fee of that donor. And, as it appearS, he

was lord of Folkingham‚ in Lincolnshire, and, on his

marriage with Matilda‚ daughter of Stephen‚ Earl of Lin-

coln‚ he received as her dowry the whole of Swaledale ;
