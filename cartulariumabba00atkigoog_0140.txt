¹ We vo, in connection with this

ond that almost certainly designatos
what is now called Biledale Beck,
and is, one may say, the most im -
ant tributary to the Seph. Fo ow-
ing the track thus indicated, we find
a modern Fangdale Beck a very
little more then e mile south of the
junction of the Ledge Beck with
Bilsdelo Beck. When Fongdale is
reached, it will be observed that the
boundary line deviates from that of
the water-comes it has hitherto fol·
lowed. In other words, it turns to
the west alo ‚ or through, Fungo.-
dele, but s along a perfeotly
definite line—‘⁶ sicut divuae eunt
inter me et Steinton.” This will be
bettledr dealt with in the note next

² It would ap that this local
designation or p nome has faded
not only out of use but out of recol-

Thin is remur able, inumuch aa it
denoted a district or subdivinion of
Weet Bilsdale which admitted of the
following precise delineatiom “totam
